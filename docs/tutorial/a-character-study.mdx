# A character study
### String Token
Up until now we've been dealing solely with numbers and indirectly booleans, but let's see how easy it is to add
String support to use with our statements. **NOTE**: The following implementation goes over and above what a String
needs to achieve, however I feel it's important to bring up these features should you use them elsewhere in your tokens.
With that being said, let's get started.

In our case we'll add String support for both single and double-quote characters. This will require a slightly different
approach in our token which I'll explain below. Firstly, let's add a new StringToken.java class to our ``tokens.literals``
package. We'll then define the following:
```java
public class StringToken extends Token<String> {

    public StringToken() { super("String", null); }

    public StringToken(String value) {
        super("String", value);
    }

    @Override
    public PatternType getPatternType() {
        return PatternType.REGEX;
    }

    @Override
    public String getPattern() {
        return "^(\"(.*?[^\\\\])\"|'(.*?[^\\\\])')";
    }

    @Override
    public Optional<String> getGuidance(String token, List<Integer> groupsCount) {
        return Optional.empty();
    }

    @Override
    public Optional<Token<String>> match(Expression expression, boolean dryRun) {
        Matcher m = getMatcher(expression.getValue());
        if (m.find()) {
            if (!dryRun) expression.cutTo(m.end(0));
            String value = Objects.isNull(m.group(2)) ? m.group(3) : m.group(2);
            value = value.replace("\\\"", "\"");
            value = value.replace("\\'", "'");
            return Optional.of(createToken(value));
        }
        return Optional.empty();
    }

    @Override
    public List<Token<?>> process(LARFParser parser, LARFContext context, LARFConfig config) {
        return Collections.singletonList(this);
    }

    @Override
    public Token<String> createToken(String value) {
        return new StringToken(value);
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return String.format("'%s'", getValue());
    }
}
```
There are a couple of differences here which I'll explain:

### Regular Expression

Considering a String is just some text surrounding with a character (``'`` or ``"``), why is the definition so
complicated? Ignoring the Java escape backslashes, the actual expression is ``^(\"(.*?[^\\])\"|'(.*?[^\\])')``. Looking
at it, we can see that it starts with the typical ``^`` which means the beginning of a String. We then have a set of
brackets which represent a capture group.

Half way through the capture group you'll see a ``|`` which acts as a logical or, meaning it can match the pattern
found before or after. Since both sides are the same besides the character used, we'll look at the first of these
``"(.*?[^\\])"``. We start with a ``"`` in this case and have another set of brackets for a group to capture the text
content found within. ``.*`` means match any character (``.``) 0 or more times (``*``). The next ``?`` means match as
few characters as possible. We then have a group of characters which, as they start with a ``^`` character mean they
are to be ignored. Why would we do this? Well, say we want to embed a String within a String, the only way for this
to happen would be to use an escape character. In this case we're using the backslash to represent that.

As such, we should be able to support both single and double-quoted Strings, but also those which contain escaped
String quotations within the Strings themselves! Because we're using that logical or though, we do need to modify
the way in which we map the capture groups. As such, this brings us onto the next change.

### Match Method

This method gets called when the lexer is trying to find a match for the next token. Typically it would use the single
capture group defined (index 1). In our case though, we've defined not just one, but embedded groups two and three
representing both sides of the or for ``"`` and ``'`` respectively. As such, we need to find which group returns a
match and use that as our value.

The majority of this code matches the method from which it overrides. The first line creates a regular expression
matcher object from the pattern and returns it. We then determine if a match has been found and if so checks a
dry-run boolean flag. This flag is used when we want to check for a match, but not affect the expression itself. If
it is not a dry-run it removes the matched portion of text from the beginning of the expression. We then check capture
group 2 (``"``) for a match and if none is found then we'll defer to group 3 (``'``). I've extracted the block of
code we're using to select the group, modify it and pass it to become a new instance of the StringToken to be returned
to the lexer:

```java
String value = Objects.isNull(m.group(2)) ? m.group(3) : m.group(2);
value = value.replace("\\\"", "\"");
value = value.replace("\\'", "'");
return Optional.of(createToken(value));
```

Unfortunately I am not aware of a method to remove characters for this scenario via regex. As such, we use a standard
``String.replace`` to remove the backslashes from our matched String. If you didn't manage to follow what I wrote above,
it's not strictly necessary to understand all of this, but if you're interested I would suggest adding a breakpoint to
the method to get a better idea of how it works.

Ok, time to test it by adding it to our configuration and giving it a try in the expression runner:
```java
public class AardvarkConfig extends LARFConfig {
    //...
    @Override
    protected void initTokenHandlers() {
        //Literals
        addTokenHandler(new NullToken());
        addTokenHandler(new IntegerToken());
        addTokenHandler(new DecimalToken());
        addTokenHandler(new BooleanToken());  
        addTokenHandler(new StringToken());

        //Statements
        addTokenHandler(new ExpressionToken());
        addTokenHandler(new ConditionalToken());
    }
    //...
}
```
Runner:
```
'hello'
Result: hello (Type: String, Time taken: 11ms)
"hello world!"
Result: hello world! (Type: String, Time taken: 1ms)
"The alien shouted \"zee oot!\", then flew off"
Result: The alien shouted "zee oot!", then flew off (Type: String, Time taken: 1ms)
```
So far so good, but let's take things further by adding String operator support. To do this we'll start by adding a
new StringOperation class to our operations package. Given the recent additions, the package structure and classes
should look similar to the following:
```
...
[src]
   [main]
       [java]
           [com.aardvark]
               [config]
                   AardvarkConfig.java
               [operations]
                   NumericOperation.java
                   StringOperation.java
               [tokens]
                   [operators]
                       AardvarkArithmeticOperator.java
                       AardvarkComparisonOperator.java
                   [literals]
                       BooleanToken.java
                       DecimalToken.java
                       IntegerToken.java
                       NullToken.java
                       StringToken.java
                   [statements]
                       ExpressionToken.java
               Application.java
...
```
In our operation class we define that either the first or second argument can be a String. This differs to other
operation classes as you'd typically want them to be in that format i.e. Booleans or Numbers. In our case though
we can use the passed Tokens value and call the ``toString()`` on it. As such, we can append whatever type it is
either before or after our defined String.

We'll add support for 3 operators for use with our String type. These will be add, equal and not-equal. You are
however free to add your own additional operators. For example, you could make use of subtract by removing all
instances of the right String from the original e.g. ``'William' - 'iam'`` would result in ``'Will'``. This could
be done by using
```java
    case SUBTRACT: return new StringToken(first.getValue().toString()
                        .replace(second.getValue().toString(), ""));
```
For this though, we'll keep things simple. It's worth noting here again that we're using multiple operator types.
If you do want to use a specific one, please ensure you are casting the ``operator`` to the correct type.
```java
public class StringOperation implements TypeOperation {

    @Override
    public boolean canHandle(Token<?> first, OperatorHandler<?> operator, Token<?> second) {
        //Other types (left or right side) are cast to Strings in operations
        return first.is(String.class) || second.is(String.class);
    }

    @Override
    public <T> T handleCustomOperator(Token<?> first, OperatorHandler<?> operator, Token<?> second) {
        throw new ParserException(String.format("Unable to handle String operation with operator '%s'",
                operator.getValue()));
    }

    @Override
    public Token<?> process(LARFConfig config, LARFContext context, Token<?> first, OperatorHandler<?> operator,
                            Token<?> second, Token<?> leftSide) {
        if (operator instanceof ArithmeticOperator) {
            switch (((ArithmeticOperator)operator).getOpType()) {
                case ADD: return new StringToken(first.getValue().toString()
                        .concat(second.getValue().toString()));
            }
        } else if (operator instanceof ComparisonOperator) {
            switch (((ComparisonOperator)operator).getOpType()) {
                case EQUAL: return new BooleanToken(first.getValue(String.class)
                        .equalsIgnoreCase(second.getValue(String.class)));
                case NOT_EQUAL: return new BooleanToken(!first.getValue(String.class)
                        .equalsIgnoreCase(second.getValue(String.class)));
            }
        }
        return handleCustomOperator(first, operator, second);
    }
}

```
Let's add our new operation class to the config:
```java
public class AardvarkConfig extends LARFConfig {
    //...
    @Override
    protected TypeOperation initTypeOperations() {
        addTypeOperation(new NumericOperation());
        addTypeOperation(new StringOperation());
        return null;
    }
    //...
}
```
Finally, let's run some examples:
```
'hello ' + 'john'
Result: hello john (Type: String, Time taken: 15ms)
'William' - 'iam'
Result: Will (Type: String, Time taken: 1ms)
'abc' == 'abc'
Result: true (Type: Boolean, Time taken: 1ms)
'abc' == 'bdc'
Result: false (Type: Boolean, Time taken: 1ms)
'Johns age: ' + 41
Result: Johns age: 41 (Type: String, Time taken: 1ms)
```
:::tip Mixing Types
The last example is mixing String's with Integer's, but this is not a problem as previously mentioned as we're
using the ``toString()`` on the Tokens value. This allows us some flexibility without having to specifically
handle these scenarios.
