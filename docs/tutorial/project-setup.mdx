# Project setup
### Dependency
Start a new project in your favourite IDE and give it a name. I've called mine **Aardvark** for no particular reason.
In most cases your project should have been created with either a build.gradle (Gradle) or pom.xml (Maven) file in the
root directory. These represent build automation tools and to which we'll need to add the following dependency:
:::tip No build file

If your project does not contain a build file then you may have created a blank project. I'd recommend to either
re-create the project and selecting Gradle or Maven, or using one of the starter projects.

:::
:::danger Not yet published

At the time of writing this, I have not yet published the dependency to Maven Central. As soon as this site is uploaded
I will put in a request to expedite this and will update this page accordingly.

:::
```gradle title="build.gradle"
dependencies {
    implementation 'dev.lard:lard-core:1.0'
}
```
```xml title="pom.xml"
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>dev.lard</groupId>
        <artifactId>lard-core</artifactId>
        <version>1.0</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```
A projects structure can differ depending on your chosen build tool / IDE, but it should have a structure similar
to the following:
```
[gradle]
[src]
   [main]
       [java]
           [com.aardvark]
               Application.java
   [test]
        ... 
build.gradle
gradlew
gradlew.bat
settings.gradle
```
### Configuration
The first thing to do will be to create a configuration file. This is where all your tokens, operators and properties
are defined which determine how your language will look and operate. We'll first add a config folder to the structure
and put our new class in that:
```
[src]
   [main]
       [java]
           [com.aardvark]
               [config]
                   AardvarkConfig.java
               Application.java
```
Extending our class from LARDConfig will require us to implement several methods:
```java
public class AardvarkConfig extends LARDConfig {

  @Override
  protected void initTokenHandlers() { }

  @Override
  protected void initFunctions() { }

  @Override
  protected TypeOperation initTypeOperations() { retuurn null; }

  @Override
  protected void initOperators() { }

  @Override
  protected void initParserFormatters() { }
}
```
Don't worry about the content of these methods as we'll get to these in due time.

### Runner
Next we'll modify the existing Application.java file in the root of the project directory. We'll change it to extend another class called LARDRunner*
and define the following in the main method:

```java
public class Application extends LARDRunner {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    AardvarkConfig config = new AardvarkConfig();
    LARDProcessor processor = new LARDProcessor(config);
    run("Aardvark Language", processor);
  }
}
```

:::tip Runner class

The LARDRunner utility class is runnable allowing you to write, evaluate and test code in your language.

:::

Run the application and you'll be presented with the following:
```
Aardvark Language Test Utility
==============================

```
From here you'll be able to evaluate expressions and debug your code. Now that we have the basics sorted, let's get
started writing our language.
