# Project setup
Start a new project in your favourite IDE and name it (I've called mine Aardvark). Add the following dependency
to gradle:
```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'dev.lard:lard-core:1.0'
}
```
or Maven:
```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>dev.lard</groupId>
        <artifactId>lard-core</artifactId>
        <version>1.0</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```
A projects structure can differ depending on your chosen build tool / IDE, but it should have a structure similar
to the following:
```
[gradle]
[src]
   [main]
       [java]
           [com.aardvark]
               Application.java
   [test]
        ... 
build.gradle
gradlew
gradlew.bat
settings.gradle
```
The first thing to do will be to create a configuration file. This is where all your tokens, operators and properties
are defined which determine how your language will look and operate. We'll first add a config folder to the structure
and put our new class in that:
```
...
[src]
   [main]
       [java]
           [com.aardvark]
               [config]
                   AardvarkConfig.java
               Application.java
...
```
Extending our class from LARDConfig will require us to implement several methods:
```java
public class AardvarkConfig extends LARDConfig {

  @Override
  protected void initTokenHandlers() { }

  @Override
  protected void initFunctions() { }

  @Override
  protected TypeOperation initTypeOperations() { retuurn null; }

  @Override
  protected void initOperators() { }

  @Override
  protected void initParserFormatters() { }
}
```
Don't worry about the content of these methods as we'll get to these in due time. Next we'll modify the existing
Application.java file in the root of the project directory. We'll change it to extend another class called LARDRunner*
and define the following in the main method:

```java
public class Application extends LARDRunner {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    AardvarkConfig config = new AardvarkConfig();
    LARDProcessor processor = new LARDProcessor(config);
    run("Aardvark Language", processor);
  }
}
```

:::tip Runner class

The LARDRunner utility class is runnable allowing you to write, evaluate and test code in your language.

Run the application and you'll be presented with the following:
```
Aardvark Language Test Utility
==============================

```
From here you'll be able to evaluate expressions and debug your code. Now that we have the basics sorted, let's get
started writing our language.
